# Homework-Challenge-2

This is a homework challenge that involves creating a portfolio for future projects and employers to view. It was a fun experienece, I got to play around with CSS a little bit. It was a little difficult, but I managed it in the end. This project taught me a lot of patience and helped fire my creative spark again, which I thought was gone but really it was there, but just needed to be expressed.
